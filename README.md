### Solving using the browser of your choice
TakionAPI is a non-browser-based automation solution, meaning it doesn't require a browser to solve antibot challenges. This allows for faster, more efficient automation across various browser OS/versions.

You can specify the browser you want to use for solving antibot challenges by passing the following headers to any of our APIs:
```
User-Agent: {YOUR_USER_AGENT}
Sec-Ch-Ua: {YOUR_SEC_CH_UA}
```

### Errors handling
In case of errors the status code is going to be 4xx or 5xx, the response body will contain a JSON object with the following structure:
